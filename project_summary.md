## Description
ColorFingers is a WYSIWYG-Location Independent Touch(LIC) based color picking tool aimed to give a unique interaction in choosing a color. It makes use of the touch interface and touch information of two fingers to select almost 16 million colors. This tool is a model to prove how touch can be interpreted in different ways to give meaning to the context underneath.
